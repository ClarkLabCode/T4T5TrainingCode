# Generating figure panels from the paper

Figure panels in the paper were generated by a combination of MATLAB and Python scripts. In order to generate a set of figure panels you can run the associated script in this folder.

### Running MATLAB scripts
In order to generate panels using the MATLAB scripts you must first add the `matlab_scripts` folder and its subfolders to your MATLAB path. You can do this by running `addpath(genpath('matlab_scripts'))`.

Many of the MATLAB scripts rely on NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate calculations. If you don't have such a GPU or if you get errors regarding your GPU, you can run `gpuDevice([]);` to disable GPU processing. 

### Running Python scripts
The python scripts in this folder rely on preprocessed data generated in MATLAB and put into the `intermediate_mat_files` directory. In order to generate this data, you must first run the MATLAB script `generate_intermediate_mat_files.m` found in this directory. Remember to add `matlab_scripts` to the MATLAB path by running `addpath(genpath('matlab_scripts'))` first. This script will take some time to finish running.

The python libraries required to run these scripts are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in this folder. You can install these libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

After running a python script, you can view the output PDF in the `python_figure_outputs` folder.
